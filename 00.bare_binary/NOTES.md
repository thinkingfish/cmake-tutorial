CMakeFiles.txt is what CMake defines as a [**directory**](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-language.7.html#directories). This is a special filename in CMake and should not be renamed.

The most common construct in a CMake directory, or CMakeLists.txt, is [**command invocation**] http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-language.7.html#command-invocations

It is strongly encouraged to have a **build directory** separate from the rest of project, e.g. source. A `_build` directory is included in the examples to foster this habit. Why build directory? Because CMake syntax is fairly flexible and supports almost arbitrary manipulation of the project. It is thus nontrivial, if not impossible, to track all temporary files generated during build and clean them up completely. In this sense, CMake has s different philosophy from automake. In fact, CMake doesn't generate targets such as `make clean`, which may be surprising to many autotools users. If one always builds in a disposable directory and points all temp files there, cleaning up becomes trivial.
