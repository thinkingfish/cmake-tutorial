`CMakeFiles.txt` is what CMake defines as a [directory](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-language.7.html#directories). This is a special filename in CMake and should not be renamed.

The most common construct in a CMake directory, or CMakeLists.txt, is [command invocation](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-language.7.html#command-invocations)

It is strongly recommended to have a separate build directory. `_build` is included in the examples to foster this habit. Why build directory? Because CMake generates a lot of files during build and by default places them under where `cmake` is invoked. The flip side of being fairly flexible and powerful is that tracking temporary files generated during build becomes hard, if not impossible. In this sense, CMake has s different philosophy from automake. In fact, CMake doesn't even generate targets such as `make clean`, which may surprise to someone who's used to autotools. Always building in a disposable directory makes cleaning up trivial.
